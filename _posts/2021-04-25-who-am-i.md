Hi! My name is Erdem.
I’m a designer & creaive technologist.

I have been interested in projects, always at the intersection of design, technology, and storytelling.

I’m glad to be able to work on really interesting and challenging projects, involving exciting technologies and complex design problems. In order to get on with more projects in the future, I’m working with a wide range of concepts and technologies to solve real problems for real people.
